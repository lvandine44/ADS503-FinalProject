### Abstract 
Predictive analysis of historical health records to determine if a patient is at risk of developing Osteoporosis.

### Problem Statement


### Goals 
1. Predictive analytics: Predict if a participant is at risk for developing Osteoporosis based on historic patient health data
   
### Non-Goals 
While our aim is to provide patients with information regarding their personal health, it is not within the scope of this project to determine the probability of a given diagnosis. It is also not within the scope of this project to provide information for further treatment barring a yes predicted result for potential Osteoporosis.

### Data Sources 
Data was outsource from Kaggle Inc.

* Kaggle Inc. : csv file Osteoporosis Risk Prediction, 1959 rows and 16 columns
